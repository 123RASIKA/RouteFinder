# RouteFinder
In this project,I've used Dijkstra’s Algorithm to find out the shortest distance between the two cities and the cost of reaching the destination based on the distance.
The user is allow to create a graph of cities. And then asked for the source and destination city to find out the minimum distance .
The output of the project is the shortest path and its relative price from source to destination city.

**List of Data Structures used-**
• Graphs
• Priority queue
• Hashing (unordered_map container of STL which uses hashing)
• Dynamic arrays (vectors)
• Pairs

**Time Complexity-**
O(n + m log(m) )
where,
n: number of vertices
m: number of edges
